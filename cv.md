## About Me
I'm a Junior Front-end developer from Belarus with a passion for learning and innovating.

My first website, which I even managed to sell, I made at a very young age (about 10-12 years old). It was a site on the platform uCoz, the theme of the site - a 
series of games "Counter-Strike", namely the various add-ons to them.

At the moment I am fully learning modern Front-end development, and looking for my first job.

In my free time, I mostly trading cryptocurrencies, making music or playing computer games with my friends.

**My strengths:**
- Fast learning
- Googling
- Teamwork
- Attention to detail

- **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS, ES6, JQuery
- **Framework:** React JS + Redux

# Code Example
**Write Number in Expanded Form:** You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form.
```
function expandedForm(num) {
    if (isNaN(num)) return NaN;
    
    let digits = num.toString().split(''),
        result = [];
    
    digits.forEach((digit, i) => { 
        if (digit > 0) result.push(digit * (10 ** (digits.length - i - 1)))
    });
    return result.join(' + ');
}
```
